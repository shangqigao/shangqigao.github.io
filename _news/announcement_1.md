**Guest lecture on Image Processing and Analysis**

---

&#127752;&#127752;&#127752; I'm delighted to share that, I delivered a 3-hour lecture to the international students participating in the Homerton College Summer Programme. Rather than focusing on AI, I introduced them to traditional image processing and analysis. It was my first time giving a lecture of this length, and I found it to be a rewarding challenge. I'm grateful to Mireia Crispin and Homerton College at the University of Cambridge for this opportunity!
