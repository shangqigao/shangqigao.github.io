### SIG-xMedIA Online Seminar

&#128640;&#128640;&#128640; We’re thrilled to announce the first SIG-xMedIA Online Seminar, taking place on 23 June 2025!

This special event will feature a keynote address by the [Prof. Mauricio Reyes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bd_3KGcAAAAJ&hl=en), who will share his insights on Explainable AI (XAI) in Medical Image Analysis.

We're also excited to host two outstanding invited talks:

&#128313; [Dr. Yang Hu](https://superhy.github.io) will present his recent work on XAI in computational pathology, published in Medical Image Analysis.

&#128313; [Mr. Yibo Gao](https://obiyoag.github.io) will showcase his research on XAI in medical image classification, which has been early accepted at MICCAI 2025.

&#128161; Whether you're a seasoned researcher or just starting out, this seminar offers a fantastic opportunity to dive into the latest advances in XAI for medical imaging.

We especially encourage students and early career researchers to join [SIG-xMedIA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sig-xmedia/) and share their perspectives.

&#128197; Don’t miss these inspiring talks—come connect, learn, and help shape the future of XAI in medical image analysis!

### Mission of MICCAI SIG-xMedIA

The primary mission of SIG-xMedIA is to foster collaboration among research groups dedicated to explainable AI (XAI) in real-world medical image analysis (MedIA). Through the organization of satellite events, SIG-xMedIA aims to:

- Establish a Specialized Community: Build a global, interdisciplinary network of researchers and clinicians to advance xMedIA.
- Promote XAI in Medical Image Analysis: Foster collaborative research to develop clinically-aligned XAI methods.
- Provide a Platform for Collaboration and Education: Create an open platform for idea exchange, collaborative events, and educational initiatives.
