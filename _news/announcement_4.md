Our mission is to foster a collaborative community that bridges the gap between science, engineering, and clinical practice. Together, we aim to advance the development and adoption of transparent, interpretable AI solutions in medical imaging.

By organizing satellite events at MICCAI conferences and biennial international workshops, SIG-xMedIA aims to:

- Facilitate Collaboration: Provide platforms for researchers to collaborate, share insights, and collectively drive advancements in XAI.
- Curate Datasets: Organize challenges like [CARE](http://zmic.org.cn/care_2024/), curating standard and public real-world medical image datasets for model development and evaluation.
- Financial Support for Education: Support tutorials, workshops, and educational initiatives to encourage diverse participation and foster best practices in the field.

Through these initiatives, SIG-xMedIA aspires to make significant contributions to the development of XAI, promoting openness, transparency, and community-driven progress in real-world medical image analysis.

If you're excited to contribute, collaborate, and shape the future of XAI in MedIA, we warmly encourage you to join us.
