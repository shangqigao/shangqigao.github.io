&#10071;&#10071;&#10071; Thanks to Dr [Mireia Crispin-Ortuzar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TRZzLJgAAAAJ&hl=en), I got an offer on Postdoctoral Research Associate in Cancer Imaging. I look forward to joining University of Cambridge and doing projects on the integration of machine learning and multi-omics data analysis for pan-cancer.
