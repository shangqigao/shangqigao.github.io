**Flash talk on Bayesian Modeling for Medical Image Segmentation**

---

&#127752;&#127752;&#127752; Thanks to the organizers of [Robust Cancer Early Detection Systems under Distribution Shifts and Uncertainty Workshop](https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk/events/robust-cancer-early-detection-systems-under-distribution-shifts-and-uncertainty-workshop), it was a wonderful opportunity to give a talk on _Bayesian Modeling for Medical Image Segmentation_.
