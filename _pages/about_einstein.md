I am a Research Associate at University of Cambridge, and working with [Dr Mireia Crispin](https://www.oncology.cam.ac.uk/research/our-research/crispin) and [Prof James Brenton](https://crukcambridgecentre.org.uk/users/jdb1003). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at University of Oxford, and working with [Prof. Clare Verrill](https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/team/clare-verrill) and [Prof. Jens Rittscher](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/team/jens-rittscher). I got my PhD in statistics from Fudan University under the supervision of [Prof. Xiahai Zhuang](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/), MSc in applied mathematics from Wuhan University under the superevision of Prof. Qibin Fan, and BSc in mathematics and applied mathematics from Northwestern Polytechnical University under the supervision of Prof. Pengcheng Niu. I got the [Elsevier-MedIA 1st Prize & Medical Image Analysis MICCAI Best Paper Award](https://miccai.org/index.php/about-miccai/awards/medical-image-analysis-best-paper-award/#:~:text=The%20MICCAI%20MedIA%20Best%20Paper,the%20award%20between%20two%20winners.) in 2023. I am serving as the president of [MICCAI SIG-xMedIA](https://miccai.org/index.php/special-interest-groups/sig-xmedia/).

I focus on inverse problems, computational imaging, Bayesian deep learning, and multi-omic data analysis. Particularly, I am interested in explainable and generalizable AI for computer vision, medical image analysis, and cancer research.

My PhD thesis is "Deep Image Decomposition and Reconstruction". This dissertation chronicles deep learning-based mathematical and statistical frameworks for solving inverse problems in photography and medical imaging as well as their applications in natural image super-resolution and medical image segmentation.

My MSc thesis is "Regularization-Based Approaches for Tensor Completion". This dissertation chronicles regularization approaches for solving inverse problems in tensor completion as well as their applications in color images, color videos, and magnetic resonance images.

I contribute to the peer review for Cancer Discovery (_IF: 30.6_), Nature Communications (_IF: 14.7_), Medical Image Analysis (_IF: 10.7_), IEEE TMI (_IF: 10.6_), IEEE TNNLS (_IF: 10.2_), Neural Networks, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and MICCAI.
